# PRank-Algorithm
This is my project from my Data Science course.
## Getting Started
Please put graph.txt file in the same folder as PRank.py file.
## Acknowledgments
The computation might take a while to finish.
You can skip the computation and see the similality scores by copying all the result files into the same folder as PRank.py File
